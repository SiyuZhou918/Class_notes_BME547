## Lec Jan 18__Intro to git  

* Mac change prompt main 

* git commit -m “purpose”

* Commit steps:
    1. nano file
    1. git status
    1. git add file
    1. git status 
    1. git commit -m “purpose”

* Open .

* Two space at the end to start a new line

* To cover the content on github, follow the steps below:
    1. git add .
    1. git commit -m""
    1. git pull
    1. git push
  

* Use different signs to start different samples: *,-,+ and with "\t"

* git commit [forget to have purpose, type "I" to switch to insert mode, then "esc" to ":", type "wq" to quit] [refer to "escaping VIM editor when git commit"
* markdown formatting
* compare versions of commits:
    1. git log --oneline
    2. git diff xxx..xxx       [deleted contents shown in red, added changes shown in green?]
    3. use arrows to display and "esc" to quit

*  git diff, git diff xxx..xxx, git diff --staged

* Can also made changes directly on github, remember to change commit description
